**DHIS2 Climate Tools** is an open, collaborative toolkit containing a reference Python environment, interactive Jupyter notebooks, and other resources for exploring and integrating climate-related data with DHIS2. 

The toolkit is designed for public health professionals, data scientists, and researchers who want to explore, visualize, analyze, and harmonize climate datasets into DHIS2. 

Notebooks include:
- Processing climate datasets and import to DHIS2
- Visualizing and analyzing climate data
- Performing reproducible analyses for research or policy support
