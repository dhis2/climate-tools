# Getting started

If you're looking to explore and run the various workflows and tutorials from the DHIS2 Climate Tools guidebook, these pages will help you get the various tools installed and setup in your environment. 

If you're a developer who wants to contribute new workflows and recipes back to the DHIS2 Climate Tools guidebook, see instead our [guide for how to contribute](../contribute.md).
