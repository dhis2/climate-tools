# Getting started

To get started with the DHIS2 Climate Tools tutorials and workflows, or to build your own workflows, these pages will guide you through setting up a working environment with the recommended tools. 

If you have already implemented your own workflows and want to contribute these back to the DHIS2 Climate Tools, see instead our [guide for how to contribute](../contribute.md).
