# Getting started

To get started with the DHIS2 Climate Tools guides and example workflows, or to build your own, these pages will guide you through setting up a working environment. They also provide a gentle introduction to key GIS concepts, an overview of the tools included in the toolkit, and guidance on different user profiles and where to begin.
