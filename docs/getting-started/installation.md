## Download the notebooks

All the notebooks and tutorials from the [online DHIS2 Climate Tools guidebook](https://climate-tools.dhis2.org/) are contained inside the [DHIS2 Climate Tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/dhis2/climate-tools). To run these notebooks on your local computer, you first have to git clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/dhis2/climate-tools


## Choose a version branch

This educational website is updated periodically to include new contents or bug fixes. Each version of the site is pinned to specific dependencies to ensure reproducibility. 

To make sure you are running a stable tested version of the guidebook, checkout the specific version branch that you want to explore, e.g.:

    git checkout v2025.1

Below is a list of available version branches that you can checkout:

- **v2025.1** – Python 3.10 (not released yet)


## Install the necessary dependencies

To setup the necessary environment required to run the notebooks, you can write:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the notebooks

Now you should have what you need to run the Jupyter notebooks. See our [guide for getting started with Jupyter](jupyter.md).
