# Guides

This section contains bite-sized, practical guides for common tasks when working with climate and environmental data in DHIS2. Each guide focuses on a specific step in a larger workflow, such as accessing data, working with geographic boundaries, aggregating gridded datasets, or uploading results to DHIS2.

These notebooks are designed to be used on their own or combined as building blocks when creating more complete workflows.
