On these pages you will find a collection of practical how-to guides for common tasks when working with climate and environmental data in DHIS2. Each guide focuses on single, isolated steps in a larger workflow, such as accessing data, working with geographic boundaries, aggregating gridded datasets, or uploading results to DHIS2.

The guides are designed to be combined as building blocks when creating more complete workflows. You can follow them in any order depending on what you need to accomplish, or use them alongside the Reference Workflows to understand how the pieces fit together. 

You can also see our [Starter Guides](users/intro.md) to quickly find the most relevant entry points for your role.
