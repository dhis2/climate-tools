The [Chap Modeling Platform](https://chap.dhis2.org/) can be used as a standalone modeling environment for climate and health, with data supplied directly as CSV files. Here we show how to harmonize routine health data, climate indicators, and other time series to be prepared and validated outside of DHIS2 before being used in Chap workflows.
