[WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org) is a research group that hosts a number of high resolution population data down to 100m resolution. These population data are based on country census data, combined with various modeling techniques to estimate the spatial distribution of population across space. 

In addition to traditional estimates of population counts, they also include more disaggregated demographic characteristics by sex and age, and a vast number of socioeconomic indicators like estimates for births, maternal health, child vaccination, migration, and other development indicators like poverty. See the [full list of datasets](https://www.worldpop.org/datacatalog/). 

The `dhis2eo.data.worldpop` module contains convenience functions for downloading some of the datasets available from WorldPop. See:
