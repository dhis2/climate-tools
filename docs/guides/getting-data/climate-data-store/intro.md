The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) hosts a large amount of datasets on their [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) platform. This includes various reanalysis datasets on a large number of weather phenomenon, as well as global forecasting products. The full list of available datasets can be found [on their datasets page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets). 

The `dhis2eo.data.cds` module contains convenience functions for downloading some of the datasets available from the CDS. See:
