The [OpenDengue project](https://opendengue.org/) is run by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and maintains a cross-national and continually updated database of historical and contemporary dengue cases. They draw data from multiple different sources and provide them at their lowest available temporal resolution (weekly or monthly) or spatial resolution (country, admin-1, admin-2). 

We provide some guidance on how to make these data interoperable with DHIS2. See:
