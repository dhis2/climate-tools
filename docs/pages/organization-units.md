# Organization unit geometries

To aggregate climate, weather and environmental data to organization units
we need to have the geometries (polygons or points). Org units geometries
can be downloaded in the DHIS2 Maps app, or through the DHIS2 Web API.

## DHIS2 Maps

Org units can easily be downloaded from DHIS2 Maps:

1. Open DHIS2 Maps
2. Add a Org units layer
3. Select "Download data" under the "More actions" menu

The organization units will be downloaded as a GeoJSON file.
