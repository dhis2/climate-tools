# DHIS2 Climate Tools

DHIS2 Climate Tools contains open source libraries and workflows to access, process and upload
climate, weather and environmental data to [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/) and the [Chap Modeling Platform](https://dhis2-chap.github.io/chap-site/).

The tools are based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and ecosystem. Python is the leading programming language for geospatial analysis, offering a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we can build on. It allows us to make complex spatial operations accessible to both beginners and experts.

DHIS2 Climate Tools has two primary users:

**Data engineer**: Integrate climate and environmental data from different sources, aggregating data to country regions (organization units) to align it with health data and import the result into DHIS2.

**Data scientist**: Analyse and visualize climate data using tools and techniques that are not available in DHIS2. It will allow you to work on raw data that contains more detail than data aggregated to organization units.

Climate Tools is part of the [DHIS2 for Climate & Health](https://dhis2.org/climate/) project which aims to break climate and health data out of silos to facilitate combined analysis and forecasting, and strengthen climate-resilient health systems. The tools are maintained and operated by the global [HISP network](https://dhis2.org/hisp-network/) to support the needs in the countries.

We also provide the [DHIS2 Climate App](https://dhis2.org/climate/climate-data-app/) which allows you to explore a wide range of weather, climate and environmental data for your organization units, and to import weather and climate data into DHIS2, which can then be analyzed and visualized in combination with health data - all without writing any code!
